I have listened to the experts, and you're not it. Neither are the dozen
people who have been harassing me about it. The only people who give a
shit about this are white guys like you.

I've talked to a lot of friends who attend technology conferences.
People who are gay, women, non-white ethnicities; people who have been
assaulted; people who have been raped. Those people are the ones that
told me this thing doesn't matter. To them actions matter, not words.
This is what they have told me.

The only people that care about the niggly bits of a code of conduct
(and you should really stop abbreviating it as CoC because it spells
"cock") are you and a bunch of other white guys. The people who actually
get harassed want to know you will do something. They don't care if you
have this bullet point or that, just that you care, and that you're
working to make sure that sort of non-sense doesn't happen.

How many people do you know that have been raped? I know seven.

How many people do you know that are gay? I have 3 in my immediate
family, and 5 more that I hang out with a on a regular basis. And one
more that is transgender.

How many people are your close friends that aren't white? Of the 10
people I call friend on earth, 3 aren't white.

I'm also married to a wonderful woman who does this shit for a living.
She used to set up policies like this when she worked in HR, and now she
runs conventions all over the United States. So I quite literally am
married to an expert on the subject.

I know the people that are marginalized by society, because they are
around me all the time. I think I have a better vantage point than you
to make a judgement about what is or is not a good code of conduct.
