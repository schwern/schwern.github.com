Another way you can support Perl is by adding a link to the bottom of
your web site, or on your credits / thank you page to

Sure. Some of these I may not have asked you yet.

 - I need you to purchase a plane/train ticket to Madison and then send
me a copy of the receipt, and I'll have The Perl Foundation reimburse you.

- I need to know your T-shirt size.

- I need you to submit any talks you want to give beyond the keynote.

Nice. I'm not sure if anyone can be "motivated" to do anything, but if
it's possible, it would be awesome if you could somehow motivate the
attendees to take some new peeps under their wing and build the next
generation of Perl geeks.

Great.

I disagree that it is weaker. It is shorter, but it's not weaker.

And ours says exactly that.

No one said it would. I simply refuse to list bullet point examples of
infractions. I'll be the judge of infractions.

I've read everything you've written below, but it's not going to happen.
The extra words on the web site aren't going to change people from being
assholes into polite society, nor will they make anyone feel more safe.


I've talked to a dozen people that feel exactly like you do and they've
all tried to convince me of exactly what you're saying. The bottom line
is I've set up a code of conduct that isn't fascist and will still get
the job done. The shit that went down in your ApacheCon example should
be dealt with by the Police, not by us. A crime was committed, and she
did the right thing and called them.  A policy would not have prevented
that sort of thing from happening, and if you believe it would, you're
delusional.

This my world, and I prefer to live in a world without bullshit. I will
protect the weak and those victimized with the greatest fervor of anyone
you will ever know. However, I will not put bullshit words on a web site
and act as if they'd have any affect real world situations.
