You might think it's bullshit, and the words might not mean much to you, but
understand that your PoV is not a concern here.  Nor is mine.  The CoC doesn't
exist for you and it doesn't exist for me.  This is hard to accept, but you
must accept it in order to truly understand and get behind an anti-harassment
policy.

The words are not for us, they are for the people who have been harassed.
They're for the people who feel unsafe in crowds of white guys because they,
or somebody they know like them, has been assaulted and then nobody did
anything about it.  The words are there to say "we will not stand for that
shit, and we will listen to you" and that is very important to some people,
but not to us because we're safe and we've always been safe.

As dudes (and I realize I'm making an assumption about you, but it is a very
safe bet), it is very difficult to understand how important that is logically
but especially emotionally.  The CoC is not for us, and we don't need it.
We're just dabblers.  As such, it's foolish for us to think we can decide
what's best.

Listen to the people who have a stake in the CoC, who have been victims of
harassment, and who have been studying this problem for years.  Listen to the
Ada Initiative, the Geek Feminism Wiki, Open Source Bridge (organizers half
women who seriously and successfully looked at the problem of getting more
women at Open Source conferences), Skud, Jacinta Richardson and whatever few
Perl women I can scrape up these days.  Listen to the dozen people who have
asked you to beef up the CoC.  Listen to your keynote speaker who has been
researching this topic for a year.  Recognize our limits and listen to the
experts and the stakeholders.

It doesn't harm you to make the CoC more clear, it doesn't limit your
authority, the experts say it's the right thing to do, and it will help those
who are the whole point of the CoC.  Seems clear cut to me.

I have many more things to say on the topic, but I won't overwhelm you just
now.  I hope the above will be enough.
