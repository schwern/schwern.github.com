I'm not going to [YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/) this year.

I'd been involved with the planning process for months, speaking with
the Todd Rinaldo (the conference organizer) and volunteers.  I have stopped.  I'd been [accepted for a talk](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/talk/4664).  I have withdrawn it.
I'd originally been offered to do a short keynote about the deeper
meaning of the Code Of Conduct, a follow up on [my keynote last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAOxGjNbp_Y).  That's not
happening.  I introduced three people to help out the conference: a
project manager, an event coordinator and an experienced Open Source
conference organizer.  Two were accepted speakers.  They have all
withdrawn. [^1]

For those who don't know me or YAPC::NA, I'd like you to understand
how serious not going is for me, and how things have
become toxic enough for me to speak out publicly about YAPC::NA and
perl.org.  I've been doing Perl since about 1995.  When you install a
Perl module, it probably goes through at least
[three](https://metacpan.org/module/Test::Harness)
[different](https://metacpan.org/module/Test::More)
[subsystems](https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker) I've
written, maintained or overhauled.  I got my start speaking at the
first YAPC::NA in 1999 and [keynoted in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAOxGjNbp_Y).  YAPC::NA has gone from being a cheapie, self-organized
Perl conference to, effectively, The Perl Conference in North America.
To not go to YAPC::NA means you miss the biggest Perl event of the
year, a chance to see friends, and the biggest opportunity to speak and be heard. [^2]

There's a lot which has gone wrong with YAPC::NA, and a lot to talk
about.  Some of it is very personal.  It's going to take a whole
series of posts.  What I'm going to start with is the biggest,
clearest problem.  They have stated the [Code Of Conduct](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/code-of-conduct.html) will not be
enforced on their own IRC channel during the planning process.  I doubt it can be trusted
during the conference.

I'm not going to get into the incidents, the details are not important
for this story right now.  How they were handled is the real problem.
There were incidents and the CoC process failed.  The particular
incident in question was verbal abuse against a volunteer on [#yapc, the advertised conference chat channel](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/wiki?node=WebchatIRC) by several
people including channel operators and a irc.perl.org server
administrator.  I was informed of the abuse by the volunteer and asked
to intervene.  It escalated from me speaking with the server admin, to
the YAPC::NA Director, to [an official Code Of Conduct complaint](/static/yapc2013-coc-complaint1.txt) including logs of the
conversations.

The YAPC::NA Director's replied saying he'd forward it onto the proper
CoC channel, but it concluded with...

    Thank you for letting me know, but this is an IRC issue. I've
    given you my opinion. But that's all it is. Is it your expectation
    that COC should have a year round operation? I'm not aware of
    anything that indicates this I definitely do not have an interest
    in performing these duties.

I received a [reply to my complaint](/static/yapc2013-coccom-reply1.txt) from
[Karen Pauley, president of The Perl Foundation](http://www.perlfoundation.org/who_s_who) speaking for the
Code Of Conduct Commitee.  It contains this.

    The scope of the Code of Conduct, however, does not extend to
    conversations on the #yapc channel that take place a month before the
    conference begins.

This is *the only* communication I have seen from this body.  I've
never heard of them before.  They have been conspicuously absent from
CoC discussion in YAPC::NA planning.  Their only action is to say they
will take no action.  If they will not take action, what is the point
of this commitee?

From the highest authorities I am told the Code of Conduct does not
apply to the times before the conference nor to their advertised IRC
channel.  This is highly distressing.

It leaves volunteers unprotected during the planning process on an
advertised conference IRC channel.  Despite a clear request for
intervention, with all the information already gathered and presented
for them, no action will be taken.  The incident was not even
discussed.  As far as I know, nobody contacted the people involved in
the incidents in an official capacity.  They didn't even express to
the abused volunteer they're sorry they were given a hard time.

A YAPC::NA volunteer was verbally abused by a long time server admin
with power and authority in the community.  I tried to discuss it with
him and was met with more abuse.  I followed the expected channels for
escalating a report, and was met not just with inaction, but outright
refusal to take action and the information that we are unprotected.  I
followed procedure and it went nowhere.  The major concern was not
that there was harassment, but with how much effort it might take to
police things.

This is deeply, deeply wrong.

Protecting your volunteers should be a *no brainer*.  The CoC
committee's priority should be to listen to and protect people with
any association with the conference, at any associated event, venue or
communication medium and at any time associated with the conference
planning, events or aftermath.  Period.

Some of these volunteers, and at least half the attendees, are new to
the Perl community.  They have no connections, no power and no
authority.  If the conference organizer and the CoC committee will not
defend them, will not step in on their behalf, who will?

I have left the conference because this, and other conversations with
the YAPC::NA organizers, demonstrates that the CoC isn't worth the web
page it's written on.  The CoC process has already broken down and the
conference hasn't even started.  The CoC Committee and conference
organizer have stated they are not invested in protecting people.  The
CoC is being treated as some optional chore.  Some contractual
obligation where YAPC::NA is only going to meet the minimum
requirements.

Fortunately, this was a relatively minor incident.  Nobody was
physically abused and the verbal abuse was *relatively* minor.  What
if this were a major incident?  What if someone were told "sorry, we
don't have the time" or "we don't think your problem is a problem" or
"they had every right to act like they did, they were busy" or "that
happened before/after the event" or "even though we sent you there,
you were in a place we don't enforce or control"?

You might think "well, if this were a *real* incident they'd take care
of it" and that's all wrong.  The point of a CoC is you *don't* get to
decide what is and is not a problem for someone else.  There was an
incident reported, someone had a problem at your event, you deal with
it.  Before you rule on the matter.  Before you decide if it's a CoC
violation.  Somebody was hurt enough to report a problem.  No matter
how *minor* or *silly* you might think it is, you uphold the CoC.  You
help the people at your event.  This does not mean you start handing
out punishment, or that you even have to start assigning blame.  The
CoC is there because we're all different, we have different needs,
different values, different problems, and we *don't* agree on them.
You at least acknowledge that their problem is a problem *for them*.
You at least speak with the people involved.  You mediate.  You
intervene.  *You get involved with people*.

The YAPC::NA organizers, and the CoC commitee, clearly are not getting involved.

It's not enough to just have a list of rules, you must get people
involved.  Why?  Because people are *messy*.  People are
*complicated*.  Their problems are complicated and messy.  They're the
sort of problems we can't *just* write rules for, can't write a
program for.  People have to be involved to interpret those rules, not
according to their letter, but according to their intent.  The CoC is
not just a list of rules, it is the foundation of a system of justice.

Why?  Because nobody else can be counted on to do it for an outsider.
Because people should be able to volunteer for and attend a Perl
conference without having to fight.  Most of all because people are
coming to Perl and getting treated badly right now.

That is the job of a [CoC enforcer](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Duty_officer).
This person's job is to receive complaints and respond to people in
crisis without being too busy or worrying about other conference
issues.  They are there for the people.  YAPC::NA does not have CoC
enforcers, nor [enforcement policies](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources).
I tried to warn the organizer months ago, and members of TPF last
year, that it was not enough to just have a CoC.  That it was not
enough to leave it to one person, there need to be people on the
ground and comitted to helping people.  I pointed them at existing
resources, the
[Geek](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
[Feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources)
[resources](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Duty_officer)
for one.  I suggested they adopt the [PyCon Attendee](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/master/Attendee%20Procedure%20for%20incident%20handling.md)
and [Staff Procedures](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/master/Staff%20Procedure%20for%20incident%20handling.md).
There was was some enthusiasm around this, but nothing official came
of it.  The YAPC::NA director thought the CoC was enough.  He refused
to do the work.  The CoC commitee has refused.  The whole thing
breaks.

YAPC::NA cannot be counted on to enforce their CoC.

There is a dichotomy in perl.org.  There are people who are primarily
concerned with the CoC as a restriction on their behavior, because
they're afraid it might be used against them, or that they'll have to
take time to enforce it, or that it might make them uncomfortable.
There are others who see it as protection, as a fundamental
requirement for any community they are involved in, because they might
have to use it.  YAPC::NA and perl.org are dominated by people who
look at this as a restriction, for them it is an optional hassle.

The CoC is for people who *do not* have the protection of the
community.  Who do not know or go against the community norms.  People
who are at risk against backlash for speaking out.  People who do not
hold power and do not know people who do.  People who cannot or do not
want to fight.  The CoC process is their advocate.  The CoC is for
them, first and foremost, so they can participate and enjoy YAPC::NA
and Perl the same as the people with power and privilege do.  The
conversation within YAPC::NA is skewed in the wrong direction.  It is
skewed towards the restrictions and hassles of the privileged, away
from protecting people.

People are being abused.  People are leaving the conference.  People
are leaving the community. The conference has lost three speakers, a
project manager, an event coordinator, and an experienced OSS
conference organizer.  One is new to Perl and programming and wanted
to find out more.  One is a former YAPC::NA speaker and prominent OSS
member.  One is a former Perl Mongers leader.  One, myself, has the
highest level of power and experience in the community as you can get.
We cover the spread of power and experience with Perl.  We have all
left in disgust or fear over the CoC process.  And these are just the
people I know about.

People like to think it doesn't happen, that Perl is somehow
exceptional.  But this sort of mistreatment happens, even here.  This
isn't the first time, and I'm not the first to speak out.  But it *is*
the first time I'm being loud about it.  Let's start being loud.

If you would like to express your opinion to the conference, email the [YAPC::NA 2013 director at admin@yapcna.org](mailto:admin@yapcna.org) and the [Code Of Conduct Commitee at coc@yapcna.org](mailto:coc@yapcna.org).

[^2]: YAPC::NA is not directly associated with [YAPC::Europe](http://www.yapceurope.org/) or [YAPC::Asia](http://yapcasia.org/).  They are organized by different groups.  I don't have details about how they're run.
