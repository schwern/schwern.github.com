Dear Schwern,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

The scope of the Code of Conduct, however,  does not extend to
conversations on the #yapc channel that take place a month before the
conference begins.

Your complaint has raised an interesting question regarding the use of
IRC during the conference and we will need to decide if #yapc can be
the official channel given the response of the community there to
Mellisa's conversation.

Best regards,

Karen Pauley, on behalf of the Code of Conduct Committee
