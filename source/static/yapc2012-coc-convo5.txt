Before you come back to me with yet another response about what a
terrible person I am, or that I don't understand because I'm a white
guy, I want to head you off at the pass.

I think its great that you're out to make the world a better place, but
save your effort for areas that need it.

If you don't want to come to YAPC because I won't take your advice about
the Code of Conduct, that's fine.  Several other white guys that sit on
high horses have told me the same thing. If you think I'm not doing a
good job of running YAPC, then put in a bid for yourself next year, and
you can write whatever code of conduct you would like. Or feel free to
use your keynote time at this YAPC to tell the audience how terrible
this YAPC is going to be because it's missing a few words from the web
site.

The point is, you're not going to convince me to change my mind. Just
let me know if you want to back out of they keynote, so I can assign it
to someone who wants it.
